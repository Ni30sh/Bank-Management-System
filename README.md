## Bank Management System

This repository contains a Python script for a simple Bank Management System using the Tkinter library for GUI and MySQL for database management.

### Description

This Bank Management System provides basic functionalities for managing bank accounts, such as opening new accounts, depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking account balances. The system uses the Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface and MySQL as the database for storing account and balance information.
